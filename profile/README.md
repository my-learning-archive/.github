## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**What is this?** This is just an interesting way I found of grouping and archiving my mostly private projects that serve as personal documentation whenever I am learning a new tool/technology. Everything goes here!

**Why does it exist?** Mostly for personal reference, but in moments of need, I can provide visibility to the private repositories, upon request.

**Useful resources?** Some repositories are made public, some are private, but I'm including down below, a list for outside reference.

| Repository      | Description | Learned Technology | Visibility |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| vagrant-hadoop-cluster | Using Vagrant to deploy a local virtual Hadoop cluster with Hive and Spark | **Vagrant**, Hadoop, Hive, Spark | Public |
| containerized-nodejs-app | Small containerized NodeJS web app, using MongoDB and Mongo Express, to learn the basics of Docker and Docker Compose | **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, MongoDB | Private |
| simple-hyperledger-fabric-smart-contract | Implementation of a simple smart contract and application, in both Javascript and Go, to learn the basics of Hyperledger Fabric | **Hyperledger Fabric**, Docker, Go | Private |
