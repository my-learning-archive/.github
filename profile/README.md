## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**What is this?** This is just an interesting way I found of grouping and archiving my mostly private projects that serve as personal documentation whenever I am learning a new tool/technology. Everything goes here! Most of these projects are very simplistic and stripped down in nature, so as to clearly highlight the core functionalities of the tools.

**Why does it exist?** Mostly for personal reference, but in moments of need, I can provide visibility to the private repositories, upon request. Some repositories are made public, some are private, but I'm including down below, a list for outside reference.

**What technologies/systems have been explored in these repositories (so far)?**

## **Big Data Engines:**
- **Hadoop (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce)** - big data processing engine
- **Hive** - structured data processing engine
- **Spark** - big data processing engine

## **Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers:**
- **Fablo** - local Hyperledger Fabric network provisioner
- **Hyperledger Fabric** - distributed ledger/blockchain technology

## **Containers and Virtual Machines:**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** - container engine
- **Kubernetes** - distributed container orchestrator for production environments
- **Vagrant** - virtual machine environment provisioner/manager

## **Databases:**
- **MongoDB** - document database
- **MySQL** - relational database

## **Libraries:**
- **Flask** - Python library for web development
- **Streamlit** - Python library for web development

## **Others:**
- **Network File System (NFS)** - distributed shared directory protocol
