## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**What is this?** This is just an interesting way I found of grouping and archiving my mostly private projects that serve as personal documentation whenever I am learning a new tool/technology. Everything goes here! Most of these projects are very simplistic and stripped down in nature, so as to clearly highlight the core functionalities of the tools.

**Why does it exist?** Mostly for personal reference, but in moments of need, I can provide visibility to the private repositories, upon request. Some repositories are made public, some are private, but I'm including down below, a list for outside reference.

**What technologies/systems have been explored in these repositories (so far)?**

## **Provisioning, Configuration Management and Orchestration:**
- **Ansible** - configuration management tool
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** - container engine
- **Kubernetes** - distributed container orchestration system
- **Terraform** - infrastructure as code tool to provisioning virtual resources in the cloud
- **Vagrant** - virtual machine environment provisioner/manager

## **DevOps:**
- **GitLab CI/CD** - feature of gitlab that allows the automation of CI/CD pipelines

## **Blockchain:**
- **Fablo** - local Hyperledger Fabric network provisioner
- **Hyperledger Fabric** - distributed ledger/blockchain technology
- 
## **Big Data:**
- **Hadoop (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce)** - big data processing engine
- **Hive** - structured data processing engine
- **Spark** - big data processing engine

## **Databases:**
- **MongoDB** - document database
- **MySQL** - relational database

## **Libraries:**
