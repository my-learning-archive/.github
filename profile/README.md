## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**What is this?** This is just an interesting way I found of grouping and archiving my mostly private projects that serve as personal documentation whenever I am learning a new tool/technology. Everything goes here! Most of these projects are very simplistic and stripped down in nature, so as to clearly highlight the core functionalities of the tools.

**Why does it exist?** Mostly for personal reference, but in moments of need, I can provide visibility to the private repositories, upon request. Some repositories are made public, some are private, but I'm including down below, a list for outside reference.
